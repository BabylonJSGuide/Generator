Much more complicated rules will be needed to determine the positions and velocities of colliding spheres. Fig 16 shows the movement of a red and green sphere over two frames when the collision is not detected, including the potential collision point and the component vectors perpendicular and tangential to the point of contact. Fig 17 shows the rearrangement of the component vectors and positions of the spheres when the collision is detected.
