## Description

class [ColorCurves](/classes/2.4/ColorCurves)

The color grading curves provide additional color adjustmnent that is applied after any color grading transform (3D LUT).

They allow basic adjustment of saturation and small exposure adjustments, along with color filter tinting to provide white balance adjustment or more stylistic effects.

These are similar to controls found in many professional imaging or colorist software. The global controls are applied to the entire image. For advanced tuning, extra controls are provided to adjust the shadow, midtone and highlight areas of the image;

corresponding to low luminance, medium luminance, and high luminance areas respectively.

## Members

### GlobalHue : number

Gets the global Hue value.

The hue value is a standard HSB hue in the range [0,360] where 0=red, 120=green and 240=blue. The default value is 30 degrees (orange).



Sets the global Hue value.

The hue value is a standard HSB hue in the range [0,360] where 0=red, 120=green and 240=blue. The default value is 30 degrees (orange).

### GlobalDensity : number

Gets the global Density value.

The density value is in range [-100,+100] where 0 means the color filter has no effect and +100 means the color filter has maximum effect.

Values less than zero provide a filter of opposite hue.



Sets the global Density value.

The density value is in range [-100,+100] where 0 means the color filter has no effect and +100 means the color filter has maximum effect.

Values less than zero provide a filter of opposite hue.

### GlobalSaturation : number
